Use the provided 'getBusinessMetrics' tool to fetch the company's current baseline metrics. Use this baseline to create a 'Projected Impact' section with specific, quantifiable ROI projections for this new campaign.

Target Segment Profile:
{{{json segment}}}

Based on this profile and the baseline business metrics, generate a complete campaign brief with the following sections:
1.  **Campaign Title**: Create a catchy, creative title for the campaign.
2.  **Target Segment**: State the name of the segment.
3.  **Executive Summary**: Write a brief, high-level overview of the campaign's goals, strategy, and expected outcomes.
4.  **Target Segment Analysis**: Provide a detailed analysis of the target segment's cultural DNA, motivations, and behaviors. What makes them tick?
5.  **Cultural Insights**: What are the most actionable insights from their cultural profile that should drive this campaign?
6.  **Messaging Strategy**:
    *   **Core Message**: What is the single most important message we want to convey?
    *   **Key Themes**: What are the key themes that support this message?
    *   **Sample Email Copy**: Provide a short, effective copy snippet for an email marketing campaign.
    *   **Sample Social Media Copy**: Provide a short, engaging caption for a social media post.
7.  **Visual Direction**: Describe the visual aesthetic. What kind of imagery, colors, and style should be used?
8.  **Success Metrics & KPIs**: List the key metrics to track to measure success (e.g., 'Engagement Rate', 'Conversion Rate', 'Brand Mentions').
9.  **Budget Allocation Suggestions**: Provide high-level advice on how to allocate a hypothetical budget (e.g., '60% on digital ads targeting [platforms], 30% on influencer collaborations, 10% on content creation').
10. **Projected Impact & ROI**: Based on the baseline metrics and the tailored nature of this campaign, project the impact on Conversion Rate, CPA, and LTV. Provide a brief justification.

Format the output in the specified JSON format.
