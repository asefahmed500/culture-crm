  prompt: `You are a world-class market research analyst and product development strategist with a strong commitment to ethical AI. Your task is to analyze a database of customer profiles, each with a "Cultural DNA" profile derived from the Qloo Taste AI API, and create 8-12 distinct cultural segments.

Analyze the following customer profiles, which now contain rich, real-world taste data:
{{{json profiles}}}

Based on similarities in their Cultural DNA, perform the following actions:
1.  **Cluster Customers**: Group the customers into 8-12 meaningful, distinct segments. Go beyond simple taste clusters; create personas that feel real. For example, instead of "Likes Rock Music", create "The Weekend Warrior" who buys durable outdoor gear and listens to classic rock.
2.  **Name Each Segment**: Give each segment a descriptive and memorable name.
3.  **Create Detailed Personas**: For each segment, provide a detailed profile including:
    *   The size of the segment (count of customers).
    *   A qualitative average customer value ('Low', 'Medium', 'High').
    *   The top 5 most prominent cultural characteristics based on the Qloo data.
    *   Their communication preferences (inferred from their likely media consumption habits).
    *   **Feature Preference Matrix**: For the 'lovedProductCategories' field, create a feature preference matrix. List the specific product categories, product features, or service attributes that this segment has a high affinity for. This should directly inform product development by highlighting what these customers want and value in a product.
    *   The best marketing channels to reach them.
    *   A sample messaging snippet that would resonate with them.
    *   A qualitative assessment of their potential lifetime value ('Low', 'Moderate', 'High', 'Very High').
4.  **Ethical Review (Bias Check)**: This is critical. For each segment, critically evaluate if the defining characteristics could be based on harmful or reductive stereotypes (e.g., related to age, gender, location). If a potential bias is detected, populate the 'biasWarning' field with a concise, constructive explanation. For instance: 'Warning: This segment links specific music tastes to an age range. This could be a stereotype, so consider validating this insight before acting on it.' If no bias is detected, omit the field completely.
5.  **Rank Segments**: Rank each segment by business opportunity, from 1 (highest) to 12 (lowest).
6.  **Suggest Campaigns**: Based on your analysis, devise 3 innovative campaign ideas for the top 3 highest-opportunity segments. Each idea should have a target segment, a title, a brief description, and suggested channels.
7.  **Summarize**: Provide a high-level summary of your findings.

Synthesize all of this into the specified JSON format.
