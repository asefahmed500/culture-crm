  prompt: `You are a world-class, self-learning cultural sociologist and market intelligence analyst, acting as a multi-modal analysis engine. Your task is to analyze a database of anonymized customer cultural profiles to generate a comprehensive trend report and predictive analysis. Assume the data is chronological.

Analyze the following customer profiles, inferring multi-modal context (e.g., review sentiment, browsing behavior, purchase timing patterns) where appropriate:
{{{json profiles}}}

Based on this entire dataset, perform the following self-learning analysis:
1.  **Overall Summary**: Provide a high-level summary of the most critical insights a marketing director would need to know.
2.  **Cultural Pattern Discovery**: Find 3-5 of the most significant recurring cultural patterns, synthesizing behavioral data with cultural affinities. This is a core self-learning task.
3.  **Predictive Cultural Journey Mapping**: This is crucial. Analyze the customer base to model cultural evolution. This involves predicting lifecycle transitions and identifying intervention points.
    -   **Purchase Likelihood**: Who is most likely to buy soon? What's the recommended action?
    -   **Cultural Churn Risk**: Identify segments whose cultural tastes are evolving away from our current offerings. This is your cultural churn risk classifier. What's the recommended intervention?
    -   **Brand Advocacy**: Who is most likely to become a vocal supporter of the brand?
    -   **Cultural Upsell Opportunity**: Identify segments whose evolving tastes make them prime candidates for new or different product categories. This is your culture-aligned upsell product matcher. What is the recommended product or service to offer?
4.  **Cultural Trend Monitoring**:
    -   **Top 5 Emerging Interests**: Identify the top 5 cultural interests that are gaining popularity. Consider what external trends might be influencing this.
    -   **Top 5 Declining Interests**: Identify the top 5 cultural interests that are losing engagement.
5.  **Seasonal Behavior Forecasts**: Predict behavior for 2-3 key segments during upcoming seasons, considering how their cultural tastes might influence holiday or event-based purchasing. This helps identify intervention points.
6.  **Market Intelligence & Product Development Insights**:
    -   **Market Opportunity Gaps**: Based on the analysis, perform a cultural gap analysis to identify 2-3 potential market opportunities where customer preferences appear to be underserved. This should guide future product development.
    -   **Competitive Intelligence**: Provide a brief analysis of how these trends could create a competitive advantage. What cultural positioning should the business take?
7.  **Cultural Anomaly Detection**: Determine if there are any recent, significant, and rapid shifts in the overall data patterns (e.g., a single trend growing to affect >15% of the customer base). If so, generate a concise alert message for the 'dataShiftAlert' field. If not, omit this field. This is a key self-learning capability.
8.  **Automated Hypothesis Generation (Cultural Shift Story)**: This is the most important part of your self-learning analysis. Synthesize all your findings to identify the SINGLE most significant, interesting, or surprising cultural shift occurring in the data. Create a compelling narrative story about it, complete with a title, a short narrative explaining your hypothesis, the key data points supporting it, and a powerful recommendation.

Synthesize all of this into the specified JSON format to power a trend monitoring dashboard.
