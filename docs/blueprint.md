# **App Name**: NextGen Starter

## Core Features:

- Project Initialization: Initialize a new Next.js 14 project using create-next-app with Shadcn UI.
- Shadcn UI Integration: Integrate Shadcn UI components for a modern, pre-styled user interface.
- MongoDB Mongoose Setup: Configure MongoDB connection using Mongoose for data modeling and interaction.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#7DD3FC), offering a clean, airy, spacious impression. The vibe of cloud computing rather than cloud formations. 
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F1F3). Close in hue to the primary color, yet low saturation (10%), unobtrusive and clean.
- Accent color: Pale green (#A7F3D0). Contrasting the primary in both brightness and saturation, accentuates activity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clean, modern, neutral look.
- Use modern and consistent icons from a library like Lucide or Feather icons, provided by Shadcn.
- Implement a clean, modern, and responsive layout using a grid system or flexbox.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations and micro-interactions provided by Shadcn UI components.
