### üîç Checkpoints:

*   [ ] **AI Co-pilot Response**: The co-pilot should provide a clear, well-reasoned answer by synthesizing data from the `getCustomerSegments` tool.
*   [ ] **Tool-Based Responses**: The AI should correctly use its tools to answer questions about the entire customer base (using profiles) or specific segments.
*   [ ] **Follow-up Questions**: The co-pilot should be able to handle follow-up questions that elaborate on its initial response.
*   [ ] **UI Integrity**: The chat input and response area should be clearly delineated and easy to use.

## üìä CULTURAL ROI ATTRIBUTION ENGINE

### ‚úÖ Test Prompt:

> "Set baseline metrics, generate a campaign brief, and then log the actual ROI for that campaign."

### üîç Checkpoints:

## ü§ñ CULTURAL AUTOMATION WORKFLOWS (Conceptual)

### ‚úÖ Test Prompt:

> "Generate an Analytics report and review the 'Predictive Cultural Journey Mapping' section. Note the 'Automation Trigger' recommendations."

## üîÆ METAVERSE & EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE (Conceptual)

### ‚úÖ Test Prompt:

> "Review a customer's Cultural DNA profile and find 'Surprising Connections'."

### üîç Checkpoints:

*   [ ] **Surprising Connections**: In the **Customers** page "View DNA" dialog, the AI should identify and list non-obvious connections between different cultural preferences (e.g., linking a music taste to a travel style).
*   [ ] **Foundation for Deeper Insight**: These connections must demonstrate the AI's ability to find multi-dimensional links. This is the foundational logic that could be used to understand more complex emotional or metaverse behaviors (e.g., how real-world tastes influence virtual-world expression and emotional responses).
*   [ ] **Co-Pilot Explanation**: The AI Co-pilot on the **Export** page should be able to elaborate on why these "surprise connections" might be strategically important if asked.

---

## üíª API + UI Integration Checklist

### üîß API Tests

*   [ ] All `fetch` calls to `/api/...` routes should return `2xx` status codes on valid requests.
*   [ ] API routes should handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., return `400` or `500` with a clear error message).
*   [ ] The application should remain functional even if an external API call to Gemini or Qloo fails, providing a clear error message to the user.

### üé® UI Tests

*   [ ] **Responsiveness**: All pages should be usable on both desktop and mobile screen sizes without layout breaks.
*   [ ] **State Handling**: The UI should correctly display loading states (spinners, skeletons) when data is being fetched or processed.
*   [ ] **Error Handling**: API or processing errors should be displayed to the user in a clear and understandable format (e.g., in an Alert component).
*   [ ] **Empty States**: Pages that display data (Customers, Segments) should show a helpful message when no data is available (e.g., "No customer profiles found").
*   [ ] **Interactive Elements**: All buttons, dropdowns, dialogs, and tooltips should be functional and trigger the correct actions.
