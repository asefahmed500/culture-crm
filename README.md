# Cultural Intelligence CRM

A web-based Customer Relationship Management system that enriches traditional customer data with cultural intelligence, providing businesses with deeper insights into customer preferences, behaviors, and communication strategies without using any personal identifying information.

This project was built for the Qloo LLM Hackathon.

## Core Features

- **Customer Data Import**: Upload anonymized customer data via CSV. The system processes, cleans, and standardizes the data for analysis.
- **Cultural DNA Generation (Qloo + LLM)**: Leverages the Qloo API to fetch cultural affinity data based on customer purchase history and interests. An LLM then analyzes this data to generate a rich "Cultural DNA" profile for each customer, including surprising connections.
- **Customer Profile Explorer**: View a list of all processed customer profiles, each enriched with their unique Cultural DNA.
- **AI-Powered Segmentation**: Automatically group customers into 8-12 distinct cultural segments based on their shared affinities. Each segment is presented as a detailed persona card, ranked by business opportunity.
- **Predictive Analytics Dashboard**: Generate a real-time report that analyzes all customer profiles to identify market trends, make predictions, and uncover opportunities. Features the "Cultural Shift Story Generator" which crafts a narrative around the most significant trend.
- **Actionable Strategy Generation**:
    - **Communication Strategy**: Generate tailored communication strategies for individual customer profiles.
    - **Campaign Briefs**: Create comprehensive, exportable campaign briefs for specific segments, complete with projected ROI.
    - **Sales Scripts**: Generate customized sales scripts with talking points and objection handling for any cultural segment.
    - **Content Calendar**: Create a 30-day content calendar based on the overall cultural trends of the customer base.
- **Settings & ROI Simulation**: Input baseline business metrics (LTV, CPA, Conversion Rate) which the AI uses to provide more accurate ROI projections in its generated strategies.
